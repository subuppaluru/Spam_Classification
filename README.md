SMS Spam Detection Project
Overview
This project aims to build a machine learning model to classify SMS messages as either "ham" (legitimate) or "spam". The notebook covers the entire process from data loading and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to text preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, evaluation, and error analysis.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the "SMS Spam Collection v1" dataset, loaded from the spam.csv file. It contains SMS messages labeled as either 'ham' or 'spam'.

Project Steps
Data Loading and Description: The dataset is loaded into a pandas DataFrame, and its initial structure, data types, and basic statistics are inspected.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Analysis of the class distribution to understand the balance between 'ham' and 'spam' messages.
Investigation of message lengths and their distribution.
Identification of the most common words in both 'ham' and 'spam' messages.
Text Preprocessing: The raw text messages are cleaned and transformed through steps like lowercasing, noise removal, tokenization, stop word removal, and lemmatization.
Feature Extraction: The preprocessed text data is converted into numerical features using Bag-of-Words representations (TF-IDF and CountVectorizer).
Model Training:
The data is split into training and testing sets.
Classification models, specifically Multinomial Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression, are trained on the training data.
Model Evaluation: The trained models are evaluated on the test set using classification reports, providing metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score.
Model Comparison: The performance metrics of the trained models are compared to determine the best-performing model for this task.
Error Analysis: Misclassified messages are examined to understand the types of errors the models are making.
Key Feature Analysis: The most important words that contribute to the classification of messages as spam or ham are identified.
Conclusion and Potential Improvements: The project is summarized, the suitability of the models for a use case is discussed, and potential future improvements are suggested.
Results
Both the Multinomial Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression models achieved high accuracy in classifying SMS messages. The Logistic Regression model showed slightly better overall performance, particularly in terms of precision for spam detection, which is important for minimizing false positives. Key features indicative of spam include words related to calls, promotions, and urgency, while ham messages contain more conversational terms.

Potential Improvements
Addressing the class imbalance in the dataset using techniques like oversampling or undersampling.
Exploring additional feature engineering methods, such as N-grams or incorporating message length as a feature.
Evaluating other advanced classification algorithms.
Hyperparameter tuning of the selected models.
Training on a larger and more diverse dataset.
Implementing a user feedback mechanism for continuous model improvement.
